## Datasets and Inputs

Due to the large size of the data files,
they are not included in the repository.

Place them in the `data/` directory
by hand.

All the necessary file paths are configured
in the YAML files in the `configs/` folder.

Currently, this folder _should_ contain (those files are gitignored):

1. `lfb-calls.csv`
2. `weather.csv`
3. `air-quality/` folder containing a handful of CSV files. A CSV per station
